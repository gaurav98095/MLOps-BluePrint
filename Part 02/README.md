## The Machine Learning System Lifecycle


### Stage 1: Scoping – *Defining the right problem*

* Identify **business needs** and success metrics
* Translate requirements into **ML tasks** (e.g., classification, regression, recommendation)
* Decide on **constraints**: data availability, budget, latency, interpretability
* Align with stakeholders early to avoid wasted effort

💡 **Pro Tip:** If you can’t explain the problem clearly in a single sentence, you’re not ready to start building.


### Stage 2: Data – *The fuel for ML*

* Data collection (internal logs, APIs, web scraping, sensors, crowdsourcing)
* Data cleaning: handle missing values, outliers, inconsistent formats
* Feature engineering: create meaningful variables from raw data
* Data labeling (if supervised learning)
* Data versioning: keep track of changes over time

💡 **Pro Tip:** Garbage in → garbage out. Even the best algorithm can’t fix bad data.


### Stage 3: Modeling – *Turning data into intelligence*

* Select the right algorithm(s) based on problem type and constraints
* Train, validate, and test the model using proper data splits
* Perform hyperparameter tuning
* Evaluate trade-offs: accuracy vs. latency, performance vs. interpretability
* Consider model explainability and fairness
* Experiment Tracking : Version Contol code, model, data, parameters, metrics etc,
* Training Pipeline Autamation :  scripting the entire sequence: fetch latest data → preprocess → train model → evaluate metrics → etc
* Resource Management : VMs/ GPU/ TPU for train and infererence.

**End Product** 
- Trained Model Artifact (`.pkl`, `SavedModel`, `ONNX`)
- Metadata (training code, data, metrics)

💡 **Pro Tip:** The “best” model is often *not* the most complex one — it’s the one that works well in production.


### Stage 4: Deployment – *Making it real*

* Package the model (Docker, serverless, etc.)
* Expose via API, batch jobs, or embedded systems
* Integrate with existing software or workflows
* Automate builds and deployments with CI/CD pipelines
* Prepare rollback plans in case of failure

💡 **Pro Tip:** Deployment is not “done” once the model is live — that’s when the *real* challenges begin.


### Stage 5: Monitoring & Maintenance – *Keeping it relevant*

* Track performance metrics over time (accuracy, latency, cost)
* Detect **data drift** and **concept drift**
* Set retraining triggers (time-based, performance-based)
* Maintain logs for debugging and audits
* Collect user feedback for improvements

💡 **Pro Tip:** Models decay over time. Without monitoring, you won’t notice until it’s too late.


## How the Stages Connect – It’s Not a Line, It’s a Loop

The ML lifecycle is **iterative**:

1. A model in monitoring might fail → back to **data collection** or **scoping**
2. New business goals → new **scoping** → different **modeling**
3. Better data → retrain and redeploy

📍 **Visualize it as a feedback loop, not a one-way pipeline.**


## Common Pitfalls

* **Jumping to modeling** without understanding the problem
* Ignoring **data quality issues** until late in the project
* Deploying without **monitoring in place**
* Overfitting in development and underperforming in production
* Failing to retrain regularly
